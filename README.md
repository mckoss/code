Code - A JavaScript Coding Playground
===
This Pageforest.com application allows authors to create their JavaScript lesson pages
(called "stages").  Users can then write code in the context of the stage, to play with
an API, learn a programming concept, etc.

To see this code in action, visit [code.pageforest.com].
