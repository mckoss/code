        <ul>
          <li><b>Completely In-Browser:</b>  You want to learn to program- not how to use IDE's, install and compile a handful of programs, host applications, etc.
          <li><b>Instant Feedback:</b>  You don't have to figure out whether you are doing it right, we will tell you.
          <li><b>Cheaper than a class, more fun than a book</b>
          <li><b>Guided self-direction:</b> challenge yourself realistically with problems we know you can solve
          <li><b>Go at your own pace:</b> as fast or slow as you want.
          <li><b>Become the architect of your own digital universe</b>
          <li><b>Free to try!</b> </ul>
